% \subsection*{Notable Projects:}\label{notable-projects}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
%   \textbf{pASSWORD tYPOS}\\
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Goal: Logging in using passwords often gets rejected due to
%     small typographical errors in the entered password, such as typing
%     `pASSWORD' instead of `Password'.
%   \item
%     I analyzed to what extent typos in password effect the usability using
%     Amazon Mechanical Turk and instrumenting Dropbox login server.
%   \item
%     I also analyzed the security degradation (if any) in allowing small
%     typos in passwords. Theoretically I showed that we can allow typos in
%     passwords during logging in without degradation of security provided
%     the distribution of passwords is available.

%   \end{itemize}
% \item
%   \textbf{Cracking Resistant Password Vault}\\
%   Goal: Encryption scheme for password vaults s.t. decryption with wrong
%   key should generate plausible looking but decoy vaults, forcing the
%   attacker to go for online verification.
% \item
%   First ever real world application of Honey Encryption. Used existing
%   password cracking methodologies in defense of password vaults to
%   create effective distribution transforming en- coder.
% \item
%   Showed effective attacks against state of the art approaches, e.g.,
%   Kamouflage by Bojinov et al.
% \item
%   \textbf{The Pythia PRF Services}\\
%   Goal: Create a remote PRF service that can be used for password
%   hardening with some added features, such as, the PRF only has access
%   to the blinded version of the password. One can rotate the secret key
%   of the PRF and update the stored hash values of the passwords without
%   access to the plaintext password.
% \item
%   Along with password generation, we also found lots of interesting
%   application like forward secure email system, secure effacing of
%   encrypted hard drive etc.
% \item
%   \textbf{Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using Relational
%   Trees}\\
% \item
%   Project Sponsored by, European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company
%   (EADS), Germany.
% \item
%   Developed an unsupervised method of learning with which a robot, which
%   is flying over an unknown region and taking snaps periodically, can
%   build a semantic map of the region and localize its position on the
%   map using those pictures.
% \item
%   Implemented the software using C, C++, OpenCV and built a front end
%   using Java.
% \item
%   \textbf{Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing.}\\
%   Goal: Tried to correct and improve fluency of Machine generated text
%   or second language writer's texts with minimum language dependent
%   information.
% \item
%   This project was selected one of the best four BTech projects in the
%   department.
% \item
%   \textbf{Creating Artistic Effects on Image using Random Digital
%   Curve}\\
% \item
%   Developed algorithm for generating irreducible simple random digital
%   curves in a constrained domain. Drawing multiple of them on the edge
%   of binary image and then setting the intensity of each pixel
%   proportional to the number of times it was visited by the curves give
%   nice real pencil sketch effect.
% \item
%   This work is published in CAIP-2011, Seville, Spain.
% \end{itemize}
