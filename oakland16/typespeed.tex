\subsection{Typist Speed and Typo Rate}
\label{sec:typistspeed}

As an enhancement of our experimental results in Section~\ref{sec:mturk}, we report on two experiments that provide further illumination of password features that lead to typos. These experiments further emphasize our observation  that typo rates appear to increase with password complexity.

\paragraph{\em Typist and typo likelihood.} 
In our MTurk experiments, we timestamped each character as
it was typed during the experiments.  We sorted the workers based on their
average typing speed (characters-per-minute) and binned workers into four
quartiles. For each quartile, we consider the subset of passwords that were
typed by the typists whose speed falls in that quartile, and we compute the
fraction of passwords that were mistyped in that subset. The data is reported in
\figref{fig:typespeed-typo}.  We found that slow typists make more mistakes than
faster typists. It could be that faster typists are also more skilled and so
less likely to make mistakes.

    typing speed, and for each quartile we report the percentage of

\paragraph{\em Password entry time.} We binned the passwords into four quartiles based on the time required
to type those passwords. The fraction of typos in each of that quartile
is reported in the middle chart of \figref{fig:typetime-typo}. 
Passwords that required more time on average to type are more likely to be
mistyped.
